                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Eren Yeager's character arc is one of the most complex and thought-provoking in anime. His evolution from a naive child to a man who carries the weight of the world on his shoulders is a testament to the depth and intricacy of his character development. Eren's journey forces us to confront the nature of freedom, the consequences of our choices, and the ambiguity of good and evil.</p>
